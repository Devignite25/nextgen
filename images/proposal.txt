1. Overview and Purpose

NextGen AgriSolutions, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit, proposes a $200,000 Housing Preservation Grant (HPG) program to repair and rehabilitate 4-5 homes for very low-income homeowners in rural Fort White (Columbia County) and Northeast Florida (e.g., Baker, Bradford, Union Counties). In partnership with JEM Home Restoration, we aim to address substandard housing by providing critical repairs (e.g., roofing, plumbing, accessibility modifications) to ensure safe, affordable homes for households earning less than 50% of the area median income (AMI). The 24-month program will leverage $300,000 in additional funds from partner contributions, homeowner sweat equity, and local donations to maximize impact, aligning with the HPG’s mission to preserve rural housing for very low- and low-income residents.
2. Program Details
a. Type and Conditions of Assistance

This program will provide homeowner assistance through grants and no-interest loans to very low-income (<50% AMI) and low-income (50-80% AMI) homeowners for home repairs and rehabilitation. Assistance will cover structural repairs (e.g., roofs, foundations), energy efficiency upgrades (e.g., insulation, HVAC), and accessibility improvements (e.g., ramps). No rental or cooperative properties are included, and no “identity of interest” exists between NextGen, JEM, or homeowners, per 7 CFR 1944.662(c).
b. Recipient Selection Process

    Outreach: Advertise via local newspapers (Lake City Reporter), churches, and community centers in Fort White and NE Florida.

    Eligibility: Verify income (<50% AMI for very low, 50-80% for low) using tax returns/W-2s; prioritize households with substandard housing (e.g., leaking roofs, no heat).

    Needs Assessment: JEM Home Restoration will inspect homes to identify repair needs, prioritizing health/safety and overcrowding relief (e.g., adding bedrooms for multi-generational families).

    Approval: A selection committee (NextGen staff and community volunteers) will rank applications based on income, housing condition, and urgency.

c. Work Performance and Monitoring

    Work Performed: JEM Home Restoration, with 10+ years of renovation expertise, will execute repairs using Rural Development (RD) standards (per RD Instruction 1944-N) or local building codes accepted by Columbia County.

    Monitoring: NextGen will conduct monthly site visits to ensure quality and compliance. Homeowners will sign off on completed work. Quarterly reports to RD will track progress, costs, and outcomes (per 7 CFR 1944.683(b)).

d. Environmental Compliance

NextGen will adopt RD Instruction 1944-N, Exhibit F-1, for environmental compliance (per 7 CFR 1944.672–673). We self-certify no adverse impacts on historic properties, floodplains, or wetlands. Repairs will be minor (e.g., interior/exterior fixes), with no ground disturbance. A Multi-tier Action Environmental Compliance Agreement (RD Instruction 1970-A, Exhibit H) will be submitted.
e. Development Standards

Repairs will follow RD standards for existing dwellings or Columbia County building codes, ensuring acceptance by local jurisdictions. JEM will provide certified contractors to meet these standards.
f. Time Schedule

    Oct 2025: Grant agreement signed; outreach begins.

    Nov 2025 – Feb 2026: Select 4-5 recipients; conduct inspections.

    Mar 2026 – Jun 2027: Execute repairs (1-2 projects per quarter).

    Jul – Sep 2027: Final inspections, reporting, and closeout.

g. Staffing

    Program Manager (1 FTE): Karly, with 30 years of experience in housing management and renovations, will oversee administration, reporting, and compliance.

    Technical Lead (1 FTE): JEM Home Restoration’s lead contractor will manage repair execution and quality control.

    Volunteers: Local community members will assist with outreach and minor tasks (e.g., painting).

h. Estimated Beneficiaries

    Number Assisted: 4-5 households (10-15 individuals, assuming 2.5-3 per household).

    Demographics: 85% very low-income (<50% AMI, ~$20,000 in Columbia County), 15% low-income (50-80% AMI). At least 2 minority households (based on Fort White’s 20% minority population).

    No rental/co-op units, so no restrictive covenants apply.

i. Geographical Area

The program will serve rural Fort White (Columbia County, pop. ~4,000, outside MSA) and nearby rural counties (e.g., Baker, pop. ~7,000; Bradford, pop. ~5,000), all meeting RD’s rural definition (<10,000 or remote areas per 7 CFR 1944.656). Census data shows 40%+ substandard housing and 25% poverty in these areas.
j. Budget

Total program cost: $500,000. HPG funds: $200,000 (40%). Leveraged funds: $300,000 (JEM in-kind labor, homeowner sweat equity, local donations).
